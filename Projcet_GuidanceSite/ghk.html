		<p>葛和凯楼由大发集团有限公司捐赠命名，位于学校门户区，南面是学校大门和门户公园，北面是学校中心湖。作为校园门户建筑，其南侧面对大草坪和校园主入口，形成与校园环境相呼应的宏大立面；建筑北侧面对湖景，以及湖对岸的学生学习与活动中心，故建筑立面由非对称的设计表现开放活泼的意向</p>
		<p>葛和凯楼的设计灵感一部分来自于巷弄街道的概念，将功能空间如教室、工坊、实验室等排列成条状，彼此之间有类似胡同的社区交流空间，形成走道、展厅等开放的互动展示交流空间。坐落在带状建筑上方的是两个呈角度的长条形体，通过扩散的角度来获得了景观视野和强调了校园的整体设计。这两层条状建筑主要是建筑和设计专业教室，以开放和高可变性的空间为主，也围合出了中庭空间，开放式的楼梯从底层的中庭和走道中螺旋上升到专教空间中。</p>
		<p> GeHeKai was donated by Daihatsu Group Co., LTD. It is located in xuexuemen district, with the school gate and gateway park to the south and the central lake of the school to the north. As the gateway building to the campus, its south side faces the great lawn and the main entrance of the campus, forming a grand facade that echoes the campus environment; The north side of the building faces the lake and the student learning and activity center on the other side of the lake, so the asymmetric design of the building facade expresses the intention of open and lively </p>
		<p> Part of the design inspiration of GeHeKai comes from the concept of alleys and streets. Functional Spaces such as classrooms, workshops and laboratories are arranged in strips, with community communication Spaces similar to hutong between each other, forming open interactive exhibition and communication Spaces such as walkways and exhibition halls. Perched above the ribbon building are two angled strips that diffuse to gain views of the landscape and accentuate the overall design of the campus. The two-story strip building is primarily a classroom for architecture and design majors, with an open and highly flexible space that also surrounds the atrium, where an open staircase spirals up from the atrium and walkway on the ground floor into the dedicated teaching space. </p>
